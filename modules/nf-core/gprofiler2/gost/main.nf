// TODO nf-core: A module file SHOULD only define input and output files as command-line parameters.
//               All other parameters MUST be provided using the "task.ext" directive, see here:
//               https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html#ext
//               where "task.ext" is a string.
//               Any parameters that need to be evaluated in the context of a particular sample
//               e.g. single-end/paired-end data MUST also be defined and evaluated appropriately.
// TODO nf-core: Software that can be piped together SHOULD be added to separate module files
//               unless there is a run-time, storage advantage in implementing in this way
//               e.g. it's ok to have a single module for bwa to output BAM instead of SAM:
//                 bwa mem | samtools view -B -T ref.fasta
// TODO nf-core: Optional inputs are not currently supported by Nextflow. However, using an empty
//               list (`[]`) instead of a file can be used to work around this issue.
